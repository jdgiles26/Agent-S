# Agent-S: Project Plan & Roadmap

This document outlines the development plan and technical roadmap for Agent-S. The project is broken down into phases to manage complexity and build features incrementally.

---

### Phase 1: Core Testing Engine

The goal of this phase is to build the fundamental testing capabilities of the agent.

- **[Epic] Browser Automation & Navigation**:
  - Develop a module to launch and control a browser instance (e.g., using Playwright, Puppeteer, or Selenium).
  - Implement robust keyboard-only navigation logic to interact with all web elements (links, buttons, forms, etc.).
  - Create a site crawler that systematically discovers and queues all pages for testing.

- **[Epic] Accessibility Test Runner**:
  - Integrate a core accessibility testing library (e.g., Axe-core) to run initial checks against the DOM.
  - Develop the system for live colored overlays to visually indicate which elements are being tested.

- **[Epic] Basic Reporting**:
  - Implement a simple reporting mechanism to output a list of found violations.
  - Store test results in a structured format (JSON).

### Phase 2: Documentation & Integration

This phase focuses on generating the required compliance documents and integrating with external systems.

- **[Epic] Government Documentation Generation**:
  - Create templates for 508 compliance checklists, VPAT 2.5, SRT/ART, and Trusted Tester documents.
  - Develop logic to populate these templates with data from the test results.
  - Implement functionality to export all documents as downloadable files (e.g., PDF, DOCX).

- **[Epic] Jira Integration**:
  - Build a module to connect to the Jira API.
  - Create functionality to automatically generate and post Jira tickets for each accessibility violation, including relevant details.

- **[Epic] GitHub Workflow Automation**:
  - Develop a feature that generates a ready-to-use GitHub Actions workflow file tailored to the tested project for CI/CD integration.

### Phase 3: Intelligence & Continuous Monitoring

This phase introduces learning capabilities and proactive monitoring.

- **[Epic] Intelligent Remediation Engine**:
  - Develop a system that maps violation types to a database of code suggestions, examples, and resources.
  - Use an LLM or rule-based system to provide context-aware remediation advice.

- **[Epic] Continuous Learning**:
  - Implement a mechanism for the agent to learn from repeated tests on the same site, identifying patterns and reducing false positives.
  - Store historical test data to track changes and regressions over time.

- **[Epic] Scheduled Autonomous Agent**:
  - Build a scheduler to run tests on production sites at regular intervals.
  - Implement a notification system to alert stakeholders of new issues found during scheduled runs.
